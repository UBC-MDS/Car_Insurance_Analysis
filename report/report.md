Prepared by : Marcelle Araujo Chiriboga Carvalho & Phuntsok Tseten 

Buying a car insurance can be a daunting task and we want to understand how marital status plays a role in influencing a person's decison to buy a car insurance or not. 

The contents of our report are:

1. DATA

We got our data set from the Car Insurance Cold Calls data set from Kaggle. The data set contains data of about 4000 customers in the United States that received cold calls for insurance purchase and the outcome from the calls, whether people bought car insurance or not.

Our data is in the "data"" folder which is inuturn saved in the main folder called "Car_Insurance_Analysis", and it contains the following two csv files:
a) "carinsurance.csv" which is the raw version
b) "cleanedcarinsurance.csv" which is the clean version


2. EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS

For exploratory Analysis we are plotting a bar plot with car insurance in the x-axis and value in the y-axis.

Our exploratory analysis is located in the results folder and the name of the file is 
"visualization.png"

3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

We will be dividing our data into married individuals and un-married individuals which includes both unmarried and divorced individuals.
We will be performing a hypothesis test on the two groups of people.

Null Hypothesis: Buying a car insurance has nothing to do with marital status

Alaternative Hypothesis: Buying a car insurance depends on marital status and that married individuals tend to buy more car insurance than un-married individuals.
